### What is this repository?

This is a fork of [solids4foam](https://solids4foam.github.io), which is a
 toolbox for performing solid mechanics and fluid-solid interactions in
 OpenFOAM, where vertex-centred finite volume solid mechanics solvers have been
 added as described in F. Mazzanti and P. Cardiff, Performance of a Vertex-Centred
 Block-Coupled Finite Volume Methodology for Small-Strain Static
 Elastoplasticity.
